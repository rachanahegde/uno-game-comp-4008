# Uno Card Game

## Description
This is a Python program that uses the Pygame module to simulate the card game Uno. Our program allows the player to play a single round of the game against the computer and generally follows the official Uno rules in determining gameplay and scoring. It also implements a rule that involves swapping cards at the start of each player's turn.
