# Uno Card Game

## Description
This is a Python program that uses the Pygame module to simulate the card game Uno. Our program allows the player to play a single round of the game against the computer and generally follows the official Uno rules in determining gameplay and scoring. It also implements a rule that involves swapping cards at the start of each player's turn. Another feature is the maximum number of turns counter which decreases by one after each player's turn and the game ends when this counter reaches zero. If the game ends because the players have run out of time, scoring and the winner is determined by the number of cards remaining in each player's hand.
